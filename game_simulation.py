# Assuming the existence of board.py, players.py, cards.py, and ship.py
# The following code would be the initial structure of game_simulation.py

# Import necessary components
from board import create_board
from players import Captain, Mechanic, Scientist, Medic
from cards import create_deck
from ship import Ship

# Initialize the game components
board = create_board()
deck = create_deck()
ship = Ship()

# Create players
players = [Captain(), Mechanic(), Scientist(), Medic()]

# Basic structure for a turn (to be expanded)
def take_turn(player):
    # Placeholder for player actions (draw card, play card, pass, etc.)
    pass

# Main game loop (to be expanded)
def run_game():
    while not game_over():
        for player in players:
            take_turn(player)
        # Additional logic for end of round, ship movement, etc.

# Function to check if the game is over (to be implemented)
def game_over():
    # Placeholder for checking winning condition
    return False

# Start the game
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_game()

# This code sets the framework for the game simulation, which we will expand in the following steps.
